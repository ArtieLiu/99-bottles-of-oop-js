`99 Bottles of Beer` is a song of which the lyrics are famous in computer science field. It goes like: 
```
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
```

The highly seemingly repetitive lyrics make it an interesting programming exercise. There are many ways to write program to output the lyrics, some of the solutions are cryptic, some easier to understand. 

In the book named <99 bottles of oop>, by writing and refactoring code that generates this song, the authors discussed the aesthetic of code, test driven development, design patterns, finally came to an object oriented design.

This repo records my code refactoring process while reading the book.
